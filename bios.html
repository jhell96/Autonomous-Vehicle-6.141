                    <p>Hi, I’m Caroline Hope! I am a senior in Course 16 (Aerospace Engineering). My first exposure to robotics was as a member my high school’s FIRST Robotics team. Since then I have interned as a design and structural engineer for Northrop Grumman, as well as focused on mechanical engineering and design-based projects. Since I am primarily a structural and design engineer for aerospace systems by trade, I am taking 16.405J/6.141 RSS because I would like to gain more experience in automation and control. I am excited about the possibilities that arise in the tech industry (specifically in production automation) with today’s growth in robotics, or as I like to see it, the meeting of mechanical structures and automation capabilities. In my free time I enjoy running, kickboxing, hiking, or really any kind of fitness activity. I also like traveling, reading, or working on photography whenever I have the chance. </p>

                    <p>My name is Josh Hellerstein, and I’m a Sophomore at MIT studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6-2). I’ve been interested in science and technology since I started taking apart computers in elementary school. This interest led me to build an EMG exoskeleton device for ISEF, and eventually to MIT, where I’ve enjoyed studying topics in signals, inference, and now, robotics (6.141). I am also involved with deep learning at the MIT Media Lab. Outside of class, I’m part of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and Vice President of the MIT Consulting Group. I also enjoy hiking and sailing on the Charles.</p>

                    <p>My name is Kevin Chan. I’m a senior studying Electrical Engineering and Computer science at MIT. My interest in robotics is primarily in the applications to autonomous vehicles. As a real gearhead, I’ve always loved cars and autonomy is the future of the industry. Outside of class, I am heavily involved in the Formula SAE team at MIT. I also cofounded the Autonomous Formula SAE team in which we are attempting to make our electric Formula car driverless.</p>

                    <p>My name is Katy Muhlrad, and I’m a junior at MIT majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (6-2) and minoring in Mechanical Engineering (2). I grew up in Tucson, AZ, but now call Boulder, CO my home. I’ve been interested in robotics ever since I joined a FIRST Lego League team back in 6th grade. Since coming to MIT, I’ve been in a few different robotics classes and competitions. Most recently, I spent January of this year working for RightHand Robotics, a local startup. I’m really excited to learn more about high level planning and decision making in this class. When I’m not programming robots, I’m either playing Dungeons & Dragons or a puzzle game.</p>

                    <p>Hello! I am a Junior in the Aeronautical and Astronomical Department. Born in Moscow and raised in Amsterdam, wherever I went, my interest in the natural sciences and love for creating have followed. I have spent summers researching Composite Materials at TELAMS, and working on creating a rocket-propelled UAV prototype with the Firefly team. Robotics is a topic I have wanted to learn and get involved in since I started MIT, and 6.141 is the perfect class for me to expand my horizons. I am taking Real-Time Systems and & Software, Communication Systems & Networks, and next year plan to continue with my minor in physics. Outside of the endless classes, I play for the MIT’s Men’s Rugby team and am a freelance photographer. I am an avid reader and avid skier, and constantly wish I was doing more of both.</p>

                    <p>I'm a senior studying computer science. My research tends to be in computational geometry. I have also done a bunch of research to create various audio effects. Sometimes those areas of research overlap. I write sample based music and DJ when I have the time. The best album of all time is Since I Left You by The Avalanches.</p>
                    <p>When I graduate from MIT I want to buy a dog and move into a lighthouse in northern Massachusetts. The government will pay you to live in lighthouses if you take care of it. Preferably this lighthouse would only be accessible by boat and have no internet access. I'm going to install solar panels and build a hydroponic farm running through the center of the spiral staircase that leads to the lantern room. Then I'm going to build a music studio in the living quarters. There will space for friends and music collaborators as they pass through. If finding a lighthouse can't pan out I have a similar plans for a small section of land in Montana.</p>
